# The Challenge

Get the flag and reach the exit.

# Solution
When I ran the instance (nc saturn.picoctf.net 61872), the first thing I saw was this:

<br><br><br>
At first I dodn't use the picoCTF webshell and I ran it localy on my computer using a socket and the python interpreter. 
I wrote a script to run a DFS for the flag and by accident  reached out of bounds of the map.
Appearantly the solution was there! And not inside the map.The output was:
position (0,0) - no flag:

<br><br>
out of bounds because of badly programmed DFS (position of (0,-4)

<br>

After seeing this strange output I ran it again in the webshell and tried reaching again to the point where the <br> 
data "player has flag : 0" changed (using the 'w','a'.'s','d' keys).
Surprisingly if you move 4 steps to the left from (0,0) you get the flag.
From there i mannualy reached the exit index (29,89) and got the flag.

In this case - bad progrmming (not checking the boundries) actually helped me solve the challenge.
